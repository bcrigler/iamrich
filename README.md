#I Am Rich

This app is a recreation of the old "I Am Rich" app that was pulled from the App Store after selling 9 copies for $999.99.  It was a single screen with a diamond icon that said "I am Rich" and was meant as a status symbol but because of it being kind of scammy Apple removed this from the App Store especially because of it's high price point and the fact that the app offered zero functionality.
